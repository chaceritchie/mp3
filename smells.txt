q4 - I removed this duplicated code through my own manual version of "Extract Method."  Essentially, I put these repeated lines in a 
	 for loop, and made a dummy variable that was set if this new inner loop reached the break statement.  If it did, then this 
	 dummy variable was set to true and then an if statement is used after to break the outer loop, which is the one we wanted to break.
	 
	 
q6 - I chose to eliminate the duplicated code through the "Extract method..." refactoring.
